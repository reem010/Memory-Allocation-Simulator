# MemoryManagment
You will develop a memory allocation simulator to allocate
variable-sized partitions of the memory to a given sequence of
processes requests. Apply different allocation policies:

1. First-Fit policy.
2. Best-Fit policy.
3. Worst-Fit policy.

● Add compaction (as option for the user): in compaction you shuffle
the memory contents so as to place all free memory together in one
large block.

Input will be as follows:  
- Number of partition  
- Partition name and its size.  
- Number of process requests.  
- Process name and its size.  
- Selected policy by the user.
